Keylogger Tool
A stealthy keylogger program that records all keystrokes made on a computer system. It's designed to run undetected and capture information for security analysis.

API-Detector Tools
This tool is designed to detect various APIs by analyzing web traffic patterns. It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and points of exploitation
 
Usage:keylogger tool

    Run the Script: Save the script as keylogger.py and run it using Python (python keylogger.py).
    Capture Keystrokes: Once running, the script will capture all keystrokes and store them in keystrokes.log in the same directory.
    Stopping the Keylogger: Press Esc to stop the keylogger and exit the program.

usage:API-Detector Tools

Developing a tool to detect API leaks involves a combination of parsing HTML for URLs and JavaScript files for sensitive patterns using regex. Regular updates and improvements to detection patterns ensure comprehensive coverage of API formats. Adjust the tool based on specific needs and expand functionality as new API leak scenarios emerge in web applications
